In order to use Skill Master you need to do three things:

1. Build the skill
2. Setup an SQS Queue
3. Edit the html page so it's monitoring your queue for new messages.

When you demo the skill be sure and have the following two pages open. The scrolling questions assist users in discovering what kinds of things Alexa can answer. The answers page needs to be open in the background so that any URLs that are part of the answer will be displayed.
